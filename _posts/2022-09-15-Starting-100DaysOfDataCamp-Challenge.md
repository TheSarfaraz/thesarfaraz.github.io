I have got carried away with work and life and ignored my blog. But here I am again.

I'm starting over #100DaysOfCode challenge. https://www.100daysofcode.com/
This time I'll learn from DataCamp . And I'm committing to study DataCamp at least an hour everyday for the next 100 Days. The courses I'll focus on will be related to Python and Data Science. Also I'm planning to make a blog post each and every day to share whatever I learnt.

If you have similar goals as mine, you're welcome to join. I Challenge you to #100DaysOfDataCamp!

Hoping to having a good journey. Feel free to follow the courses with me and comment.
