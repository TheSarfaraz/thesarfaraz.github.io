Assalamu Alaykum!
Peace be on you. Welcome to my website/blog

I'm starting this blog as a place to share my thoughts, experiences, and learning so that you can comment and help me learn more, or you can join the journey.
There is no particular theme to this blog and I will share whatever I focus on.
I'm hoping most of the posts will be about **Machine Learning** since that is the primary focus of my life right now. I'm trying to learn Data Science and Machine Learning and will share my learning so anyone can join or find it helpful.

Hoping to having a good journey. Feel free to explore and comment.
